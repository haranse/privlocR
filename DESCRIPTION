Description: A package for privacy preserving location classification. Given a
     set of coordinates and pre-downloaded location data from OpenStreetMap
     (which the package can help you find) retrieves tags of locations at a
     certain distance atound each coordinate, such as "shop","ocean","residential".
     This allows for assigning meaning to locations observed in research, while
     preserving participant privacy. Coordinates are never sent online, and
     calculations are reproducible even if OpenStreetMap changes, as long as 
     the location data files are preserved.
